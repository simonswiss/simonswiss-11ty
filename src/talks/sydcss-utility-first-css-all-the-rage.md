It's no secret that I am a big fan of utility-first CSS. Like everyone, I _hated it with a passion_.. until I gave it a real go!

After using Tachyons with great success for over a year, I thought it would be interesting to share my experience with the [lovely SydCSS community](http://sydcss.com) and give them my take on this controversial approach to styling websites.

There is unfortunately no video recording of the talk, but here's a [link to the slides](http://slides.com/simonswiss/utility-first-all-the-rage)!
