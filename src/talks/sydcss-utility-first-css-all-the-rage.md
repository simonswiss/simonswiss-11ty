<IntroText>
  With functional/atomic CSS, it's never love at first sight: it looks bizarre
  and challenges well established best practices. Let's look beyond the initial
  gut reaction and discover why more and more teams adopt this radically
  different way to think about CSS.
</IntroText>

It's no secret that I am a big fan of utility-first CSS. Like everyone, I _hated it with a passion_.. until I gave it a real go!

After using Tachyons with great success for over a year, I thought it would be interesting to share my experience with the [lovely SydCSS community](http://sydcss.com) and give them my take on this controversial approach to styling websites.

There is unfortunately no video recording of the talk, but here's a [link to the slides](http://slides.com/simonswiss/utility-first-all-the-rage)!
