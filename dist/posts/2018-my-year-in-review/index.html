<IntroText>
  2017 had finished with a{' '}
  <Link to="/talks/sydcss-utility-first-css-all-the-rage">talk at SydCSS</Link>{' '}
  that got very positive feedback. I was amped up and full of ambition for the
  year 2018. How did it stack up?

<h2>Starting with a bang 💥</h2>
<p>New Year resolutions are fun. Most of the time, they're out the window within a few weeks.</p>
<p>In this case, one thing I <strong>really</strong> wanted to do was to produce an <a href="https://egghead.io">egghead.io</a> course on <a href="https://tailwindcss.com">TailwindCSS</a>.</p>
<p>The sooner the better. I committed early, and within the first two weeks of the year, I was done. My course was in queue for publishing.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, there it was! <a href="https://egghead.io/courses/build-user-interfaces-by-composing-css-utility-classes-with-tailwind">Build User Interfaces by Composing CSS Utility Classes with Tailwind</a>.</p>
<p>As I am writing this post, the course has been completed by <strong>more than 400 people</strong> and has a <strong>rating of 4.6/5</strong> based on 83 ratings!</p>
<h2>Building a team 💪</h2>
<p>In March, I organised my first series of interviews, as we were hiring for a front-end developer position at <a href="https://societyone.com.au">SocietyOne</a></p>
<p>I was responsible for creating the job ad, promoting it, reviewing applicants, scheduling phone interviews, in-person interviews etc.</p>
<p>I surprisingly <em>really enjoyed</em> the whole process. I think I was pretty good at it too! A few applicants mentioned they found the whole procedure very friendly and well conducted. 🤗</p>
<p>In April, we hired a fantastic candidate, my now good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/VerityStothard">Verity Stothard</a>, who turned out to be a great fit!</p>
<h2>Berlin Bound! ✈️🍻</h2>
<p>This is a big one for me. One of these <em>way out of the comfort zone</em> thing.</p>
<p>On May 15th 2018, my good buddy <a href="https://twitter.com/nystudio107">Andrew Welch</a> suggested I submitted a talk for the <a href="https://dotall.com/2018">DotAll 2018</a> conference organised by the <a href="https://craftcms.com">CraftCMS</a> folks.</p>
<p>The <em>Call For Speakers</em> was closing in less than 24 hours. I giggled, and went back to work.</p>
<p>“Seriously, Simon. Submit a talk”, Andrew said.</p>
<p><em>Sure, why not</em>. So I put together a talk outline for a topic I have at heart: utility-first CSS.</p>
<p>The next morning, I woke up to an e-mail titled “<em>Speaking at Dot All 2018</em>”.</p>
<p>😱😱😱</p>
<p>Just like that, I found myself embarking on an epic 40+ hour journey across the globe to Berlin!</p>
<p>The CraftCMS community is special. It's truly something else. I couldn't wait to catch up with all these people I consider friends but have never met in real life.</p>
<p>Slack buddies, twitter buddies, but no IRL buddies.</p>
<p>Oh and my close friend, mentor, colleague, and the reason I submitted the talk in the first place: Andrew Welch.</p>

/&gt;</p>
<p>I had a blast! The conference was superb. Such a welcoming and interesting community. Everyone knows each other from Slack, but mingling in person was awesome.</p>
<p>Uumm.. so <Link to="/talks/real-life-journey-utility-first-css">my talk</Link> was scheduled
to close day 1 of the conference. Sort of a mini keynote! :) It went extremely well
and the discussions it sparked showed my presentation definitely hit a nerve.</p>
<p>These few days in Berlin are a sure highlight of my year!</p>
<h2>Laracon AU 🇦🇺</h2>
<p>Same talk, different community. <em>Home crowd</em> here in Sydney.</p>
<p>My second ever conference talk, and also my second in three weeks!</p>
<p>Stepping on stage didn't feel nearly as overwhelming as it did in Berlin. I had done it before, and although still very nervous, I knew I could do it again.</p>
<p>This time, my talk was scheduled early in the morning. The second talk of the conference, right after the headline opening act: <a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan">Adam Wathan</a>.</p>
<p>Holy crap.</p>
<p>Adam is <em>kind of a big deal</em> in the Laravel community. He is also the author of <a href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind CSS</a>, a utility-first CSS framework I feature multiple times in my talk.</p>
<p>It was both an honour and a fright to go right after Adam.</p>
<p>The talk went well. I had some dreadful &quot;clicker&quot; hiccups that messed up the flow of my talk (timing, jokes..) but I am happy with how I delivered the talk overall. The <a href="https://thermostat.io/p/1222e409/ce7aec33e98dbce4">feedback from the audience</a> was really positive too!</p>
<p>Overall, another incredible conference. The talks were very interesting, but again my highlight was the people I met.</p>
<p>Oh - hanging out with 3/4 of the Tailwind CSS crew was real fun! It's awesome to spend some quality time with people that build software you use every day. I am a people person, and getting to know the fine folks behind Tailwind makes me appreciate the framework 10x more!</p>
<h2>B'ball Championship 🏀🏆</h2>
<p>If I'm not writing code, I love playing basketball and surfing.</p>
<p>When I moved to Sydney 4 years ago, I joined a rec league competition, it's good fun!</p>
<p>The team is awesome. We're almost all dads. At 37, I am one of the youngest players on the team. But we whooped a bunch of athletic teams in their early 20s.</p>
<p>We get in their heads and grind them out. And we're the league champs! 💪</p>
<p>Love this team. As long as I live in Sydney, I'll be playing with them! Years go by and I get slower, but I can still drain threes like there's no tomorrow! 👌</p>

<h2>Landed a new job 🙌</h2>
<p>To wrap things up - I have some exciting news: I will be joining the <a href="https://thinkmill.com.au">Thinkmill</a> in January 2019.</p>
<p>This should be really exciting, very much looking forward to this new chapter!</p>
<h2>Wrapping it up</h2>
<p>I am pretty pleased with myself and what I have accomplished in 2018. I am now wrapping up the year with my little family on a camping trip.</p>
<p>See you all in 2019! ❤️</p>
